# Odin Landing Page

## Motivation
Page created for practicing basic CSS, as it has been my first experience with it.  
One cannot learn only by reading docs, so a practical task is always going to deepen the understanding.  

## Practiced concepts
- Box model
- Basic layout: normal flow
- Flex layout
